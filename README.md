1.Exercise
This dataset has details about the water availability in the four main reservoirs over the last 15 years

-Poondi
-Cholavaram
-Redhills
-Chembarambakkam
The data is available on a daily basis and the unit is million cubic feet.

Inspiration
The idea is to see if we can use this dataset to

Visualize the water need / usage of the city
Identify whether the water sources availability will be able to meet the needs till the subsequent monsoon?
How bad is the current water crisis compared to previous years?
